# CMSC 608 Homework 2



## Tasks
The list below highlights key specifications for this deliverable. Please review the rubric in Canvas for specific details:

1. Create a  report.qmd file in Quarto and provide different sections of your report and render this as an html or pdf file for submission in CANVAS and GITHUB. Your task is to clean it up to reflect your work.
2. The student is to update the URL at the top of the report.qmd file to reflect their own github file. The other header information should also be updated. 
3. Below are six problem descriptions. PICK ANY THREE and design Chen (graphviz) AND Crows Foot (mermaid) ER diagrams for each.
4. All entities, attributes and relationships should be identified on both diagrams and appropriate cardinality and participation identified on the Crows Foot diagram.
5. There is NO SINGLE SOLUTION to these designs. Each has tradeoffs and design choices. Students should discuss any design choices or decisions that they made. For example, were any weak entities introduced into the system, or did you choose to create composite attributes, or did you choose to create a multivalued attribute rather than creating a separate entity?
6. Students should include a bulleted list of the relation set schemas, of the form entity( primary key, attributes …) as demonstrated in the lectures for each problem.
7. Students should also create/modify the README.md file in their project root, tailored to this specific homework assignment and deliverables.  This is an important part of project documentation. This link provides suggestions for writing good README.md files.
8. The QMD file should be rendered to HTML and when you’re ready, uploaded to Canvas as your submission.
9. Be sure to add, commit and push all your local changes back to GITHUB. The TAs will be reviewing your GITHUB repository by following the link provided at the top of your report.


## 
I chose the first 3 problem descriptions on the list: the library management system, the restaurant reservation system, and the real estate listing system. All of the problems looked similar and had similar challenges.
