My general approach follows the one taught in class: nouns are entites and verbs are relationships. I expect I will have to refine the database design before finalizing.

# Library Management System
Picture a library that needs to manage books, members, and loans. Each book has a book ID, title, and author. Members have a member ID, name, and membership date. Loans have a loan ID, loan date, and return date. A member can borrow multiple books, and each book can be borrowed by multiple members over time. Each loan is associated with a single member borrowing a single book.

First I start by picking out the nouns/entities and attributes. I anticipate that a loan will need to reference both a member and a book, so I include a Book ID FK and a Member ID FK in the loan entity.

 - Book(ID, Title, Author)
 - Member(ID, Name, Membership Date)
 - Loan(ID, Loan Date, Return Date, Book ID, Member ID)

    MEMBER ||--o{ LOAN : "loans to"
    MEMBER {
        int ID
        String name
        Date membership_date
    }
     BOOK  ||--o{ LOAN: "loans a"
    LOAN {
        int ID
        Date loan_date
        Date return_date
        int book_id
        int member_id
    }
    BOOK {
        int ID
        String title
        String author
    }
```

```{dot}

	node [shape=diamond,style=filled,color=lightgrey]; "Lends a"; "Lends to";

    book_id -- BOOK;
    title -- BOOK;
